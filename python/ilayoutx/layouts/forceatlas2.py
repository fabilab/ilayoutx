    """ForceAtlas2 algorithm from Gephi.

    Parameters:
        network: The network to layout.
        initial_coords: Initial coordinates for the nodes.
        jitter_tolerance: Controls the tolerance for adjusting the speed of layout generation.
        scaling_ratio: Determines the scaling of attraction and repulsion forces.
        gravity: Determines the amount of attraction on nodes to the center. Prevents islands
            (i.e. weakly connected or disconnected parts of the graph) from drifting away.
        distributed_action: Distributes the attraction force evenly among nodes.
        strong_gravity: Applies a strong gravitational pull towards the center.
        mass: Maps nodes to their masses, influencing the attraction to other nodes.
        size: Maps nodes to their sizes, preventing crowding by creating a halo effect.
        dissuade_hubs: Prevents the clustering of hub nodes.
        linlog: Uses logarithmic attraction instead of linear.
        etol: Gradient sum of spring forces must be larger than etol before successful termination.
        max_iter: Max iterations before termination of the algorithm.
        seed: A random seed to use.
    Returns:
        The layout of the network.

    NOTE: This layout computed all mutual distances between nodes, which scales with O(n^2). On a
    laptop as an example, this works until around 1,000 nodes, after which numpy.linalg starts
    throwing overflow errors.
